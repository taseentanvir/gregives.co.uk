The other day, I needed to change a number of class names, something like this:\n\n```css\n/* From these class names */\n.projects__project,\n.projects__project-title,\n.projects__project-date,\n.posts__post,\n.posts__post-title,\n.posts__post-date\n\n/* To these class names */\n.project,\n.project__title,\n.project__date,\n.post,\n.post__title,\n.post__date\n```\n\nI could have manually replaced all the occurrences or used a VSCode keyboard shortut like `Ctrl+D`, however, these class names existed over many files.\n\n### Regex to the Rescue\n\nA regex, short for regular expression, is a **pattern used to match character combinations in strings**. I used the following regex to find and replace all occurrences of the class names.\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Find</td>\n      <td><code>\\.(project|post)s(?:(__)\\1-(\\w+)|__\\1)</code></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Replace</td>\n      <td><code>.$1$2$3</code></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nA few years ago, I wouldn't have had the faintest idea what that regex meant, or even where to begin --- you can see parts of the class names we are looking for, but the latter half of the regex is mostly incomprehensible. As with anything, **practice is key** to writing regular expressions. I frequently refer to the online tool [regexr.com](https://regexr.com) as a cheatsheet and an easy way to test out regexes; here's [the above regex](https://regexr.com/4v5lj) in regexr.com, which will allow you to see what each part of the regex does.\n\nRegex can be used for all sorts of things, from input validation to data extraction.
